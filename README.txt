This app adds support for Nilan Heatpumps, such as EC9 - running with CTS602
while also combining support for CTS700.

App uses TCP Modbus for communication though RS-485.
For TCP Modbus connection, a bridge device is required; I personally can
recommend cheap Elfin EW11, which works very nicely and has proven for me to be stable.
It also accepts +12V provided by Nilan's heat pumps.

App is very comprehensive and provides a lot of sensor data. You also get to control
temperatures, humidity and modes of device - and can also do this with flows if you
choose to.

This app was built on top of already existing SystemAir app by Bj√∏rnar Almli, so thank
you for that, propably couldn't have built this without his work.
